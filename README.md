> We need you! These exercises are built and maintained in collaboration with contributors such as yourself. If you find any bugs or misspellings please contribute and/or report them.

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/javascript-beginner-exercises-tutorial) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-beginner-exercises-tutorial.git).

> Once you have VSCode open the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local Installation

[Clone the repository](https://4geeks.com/how-to/github-clone-repository) in your local environment and follow the steps below:

1. Install LearnPack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the node compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 16+:

```bash
$ npm i @learnpack/learnpack -g
```

2. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```bash
$ learnpack start
```
<!-- endhide -->

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading, but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion, or you may get frustrated.

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small React application containing the following files:

1. **app.js:** represents the entry JavaScript file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** contains the testing script for the exercise (you don't have to open this file).
